The aspiration of the Office of Institutional Research is to aid the evaluation and planning efforts of the University's senior administration by organizing studies on the University's academic programs, policies etc. Institutional Research collects, preserves and disseminates institutional data, ensuring its integrity and accuracy and of course information from student enrollment history, employee history and faculty activity. When student need advisement from their graduate advisor all his/her record of enrollment, courses, student history will play a very crucial role in advisement but still advisor must go through all his/her statistics to come up with an advice. It takes a lot of valuable time of graduate advisor, to reduce that time UGA’s OIR come up with an idea of the advising tool which will help advisor to advise student based on student’s information. In this tool, there is a module ‘what if’ which is used to predict success of student if they want to change their major from one to another. This paper is about finding suitable and most accurate machine learning algorithm to add feature which will predict preferred course for that specific student in which he/she can succeed. This will finally result to predict his/her time to degree which is the final goal of this advising tool.
